# Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Within our Sequential Decision Making framework $(S, A, T, R, \gamma)$, we have thus far assumed the reward function $R(s, a)$ is explicitly defined. However, in many real-world scenarios, particularly when attempting to replicate human or animal behavior, this assumption breaks down.

**Inverse Reinforcement Learning** (IRL) addresses this challenge by attempting to recover the underlying reward function from observed behavior. The fundamental premise of IRL stems from a practical observation: while we can often observe expert demonstrations of desired behavior (whether from humans, animals, or existing systems), articulating the precise reward function that drives these behaviors is notably challenging, especially when the reward function is multi-attribute (how can we determine the relative weights a priori?). Even with extensive behavioral studies and neurophysiological evidence, extracting accurate reward functions through empirical investigation remains difficult. IRL can be formalized as the inverse problem of RL: given observed optimal (or near-optimal) behavior following some policy $\pi$, we aim to infer the reward function R that makes this behavior optimal. This becomes particularly complex in scenarios with multiple competing objectives, where the observed behavior might result from balancing various factors - a situation common in human decision-making. However, this inverse problem has a fundamental problem, degeneracy: multiple reward functions can explain the same observed behavior, requiring additional assumptions or constraints to identify meaningful solutions [^1].
